										<strong>What is 'approved used?</strong><br>
										Approved used cars undergo certain checks before being sold and need to meet specific standards to be sold in approved used schemes.</p>
										<p id="sub_article">
										<strong>Why choose 'approved used'?</strong><br>
										Approved used cars are typically 'good as new', yet can save you thousands by comparison, often featuring full histories and low mileages</p>
										<p id="sub_article">
										<strong>How does it benefit you?</strong><br>
										Sold by most reputable dealers, approved used cars give you that extra reassurance and peace of mind when buying a used car.</p>
										<p id="sub_article">
										<strong>What do you get?</strong><br>
										While schemes vary from dealer to dealer, buyers typically get a 12 month guarantee, breakdown cover and a roadside rescue package.</p>
